## Analysis Overview
In this analysis, a school district approached our team to analyze inconsistencies in 9th grade scores, with concerns over falsified reporting. The school district was also interested in overall metrics comparing grades to total school budget, total students per school, to average math and reading scores, to the passing percent for reading and math, and the overall passing percentage.

As part of this analysis, we replaced inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School and kept the remaining data intact.

##Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

###How is the district summary affected?
  *The district summary is minimally affected, with math averages going from 78.98% to 78.93% and reading averages going from 81.87% to 81.85%.
###How is the school summary affected?
  *The average for Thomas High School decreases slightly
###How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  *It goes down slightly
###How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type


## Results
Most of the metrics remain the same or changed only very little. This is because grades altered in one grade at one school skew the data for the entire district very little.
